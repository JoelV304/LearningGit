# # What is Git??
Git is a **version control** software. It maintains different versions of our code/project as well as a history of our changes.
## What is a commit
In Git a commit is a checkpoint of the changes we made in our project. We can review all previous commits and revert back to any point in time we may want to. It's important to put clear commit messages, so you know what changes had occured there.

## What is a branch?
A branch is a different version of our code that comes from a certain commit. Changes that occur in a certain branch don't affect the main or any other branch. They're independent until they are merged with another branch
